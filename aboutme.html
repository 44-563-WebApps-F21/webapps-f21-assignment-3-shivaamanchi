        <h4>My favourite super hero "Iron Man"</h4>
        <p>He is one who Marvel built the entire Iron Man person around.
            Iron Man possesses powered armor that gives him superhuman strength and durability, flight, and an array of weapons. 
            The armor is invented and worn by Stark (with occasional short-term exceptions).
