        <h2>Green Abomination</h2>
        <p>Formerly known as Emil Blonsky, a spy of Soviet Yugoslavian origin working for the KGB.
           The Abomination gained his powers after receiving a dose of gamma radiation similar to that which transformed Bruce Banner into the incredible Hulk.
           As a result he was permanently transformed into a massive green-skinned monster whose physical power was equivalent to, if not greater than, that of the Hulk.
           While he was able to maintain his normal level of self-control and intelligence after this transformation, he is unable to return to human form.
